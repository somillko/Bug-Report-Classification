# Bug-Report-Classification
Determining the type of Bug so that relevant developer can be applied.

## Dataset
### The dataset is available on this link

The dataset used for our classification process was used from the JAVA Lucene project hosted on Atlassian. We used Jira Issue tracking System for downloading our Bug Reports in a Csv Format
The dataset originally had many rows out of which many are useless so I've discarded them and in the end we are left with 13 rows, namely:-
* Issue Key
* Issue ID
* Summary
* Status
* Description
* Priority
* Resolution
* Assignee
* Created 
* Updated
* Last Viewed
* Resolved
* Issue Type
